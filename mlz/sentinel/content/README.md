# MLZ Sentinel Content

Curate all Sentinel content that is customized for Mission Landing Zone in this folder.

- `analytic-rules/` – YAML analytic rule templates aligned with MLZ detection requirements.
- `hunting-queries/` – Saved hunting queries delivered with the MLZ package.
- `metadata/` – Metadata manifests (solutions, template specs) specific to MLZ.
- `playbooks/` – Logic Apps or workflow definitions that automate response scenarios for MLZ.
- `workbooks/` – Workbook JSON templates that visualize MLZ telemetry.

Import content from the baseline repository paths only when necessary, and track MLZ-specific adjustments in each file so you can contribute improvements upstream later.

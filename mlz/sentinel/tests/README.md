# MLZ Sentinel Tests

Place automated validation for the MLZ Sentinel package here. Examples:

- Pester tests that confirm required resources are deployed with the right settings.
- Script-based smoke tests for analytic rule deployment.
- Pipeline definitions that run the tests in CI.

Document prerequisites or environment variables needed to execute the tests so the Mission Landing Zone team can integrate them into their verification pipeline.
